# Your basic cat

![your basic cat](./images/basicBecky.jpg?raw=true)

So…we’re going to create a Cat class that explains all a cat can do! What can a cat do? Well, if you have a cat, you know it’s a bunch, but we’re going to try to keep to the basics…kind of…

This is your basic cat.

```
class Cat {
  meow () { console.log('meow!'); }
  eat () { console.log('crunch!'); }
  purr () { console.log('puuurrrrrrrr');}
  sleep() { console.log('zzzz'); }
}
```
